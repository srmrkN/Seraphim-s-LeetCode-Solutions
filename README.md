# Seraphim's LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to **Seraphim's LeetCode Solutions**! This repository is my personal collection of solutions to algorithmic challenges, primarily from LeetCode, with a sprinkle of problems from other platforms like Stepik. Written in **C#**, these solutions reflect my ongoing journey to master data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills for coding interviews and beyond.

## About This Repository
Here, you'll find a growing archive of solutions crafted with care and optimized for clarity and efficiency. Each solution is a step in my quest to tackle new challenges, from arrays and strings to dynamic programming and sorting algorithms (like the Quick Sort I recently explored!). I'm continuously adding new solutions as I dive deeper into the world of algorithms, so expect regular updates.

## Progress Tracker
Want to dive deeper into my problem-solving journey? Check out my **[LeetCode Progress Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19qzXY4bmGvv0mWyOsR4SRS7Zb5QOuNotxy78_NB_F6g/edit?usp=sharing)** on Google Sheets! It summarizes each problem with details like approach, complexity, and categories, offering a serene overview of my ongoing quest to conquer algorithms.


## Why This Exists
- **Learning & Growth**: I’m passionate about sharpening my coding skills and understanding the intricacies of algorithms. This repo is my playground for experimentation and improvement.
- **Interview Prep**: Solving problems here prepares me for technical interviews by building a strong foundation in problem-solving.
- **Community & Sharing**: I hope my solutions inspire others or spark discussions. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or share your own approaches!

## What's Inside
- **C# Solutions**: Clean, well-commented code for a variety of algorithmic problems.
- **Problem Categories**: Covering arrays, strings, stacks, binary search, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Ongoing Commitment**: New solutions are added regularly as I tackle daily challenges and explore new topics.

## How to Navigate
- Browse the codebase to find solutions organized by problem or category.
- Check the commit history for my latest additions.
- Each solution includes the problem context (where applicable) and explanations in the code comments.

## Future Plans
I’m just getting started! Expect more solutions, optimizations, and possibly explorations into other languages or advanced topics like graph algorithms. My goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of my coding skills while enjoying the process—perhaps with some ASMR in the background for that extra focus ^^.

## Get Involved
- **Feedback**: Have suggestions or spotted a better approach? Open an issue or pull request!
- **Connect**: Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/srmrkN) or share your own coding journey.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s keep coding, learning, and solving problems together.
